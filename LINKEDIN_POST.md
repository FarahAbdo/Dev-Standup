## Post Option 1: Technical Focus

🚀 Just built "Dev-Standup Automator" - Never forget what you did for standup again!

Ever find yourself struggling to remember what you worked on yesterday for the daily standup? I created a CLI tool that solves this problem using AI!

✨ What it does:
• Accepts any GitHub repository URL
• Automatically scans git commits from the last 24 hours
• Uses local AI (Ollama) to generate human-readable summaries
• No API keys needed - runs 100% locally!

🎭 The best part? Three personality modes:
→ Neutral: Professional summaries for real standups
→ Roast: Sarcastic commentary on your code (for laughs)
→ Hero: Epic battle narratives of your bug fixes

🔧 Tech Stack:
• Python + Click for CLI
• GitPython for repository scanning
• Ollama for local LLM processing
• Colorama for beautiful terminal output

💡 Use case: Just paste any repo URL and get instant AI-powered summaries:
```
python run.py --repo https://github.com/user/repo --all-authors --mood roast
```

Perfect for developers who want to save time and add some fun to their standups!

## Post Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

😅 Raise your hand if you've ever said "Umm..." at the start of standup because you forgot what you did yesterday 🙋‍♂️

I built a solution: Dev-Standup Automator - an AI-powered CLI that generates your standup summary in seconds!

🎯 The Problem:
Developers make dozens of commits daily. Remembering them all? Nearly impossible.

✅ The Solution:
Just paste your GitHub repo URL, and get an instant AI summary of recent commits!

🚀 Key Features:
• Works with ANY GitHub repo (or local repos)
• Uses free local AI (Ollama - no API costs!)
• Shallow cloning - won't fill up your disk
• Auto-cleanup - no manual maintenance
• 3 personality modes (serious, sarcastic, or epic)

💼 Real Impact:
→ Save 5-10 minutes before every standup
→ Never miss mentioning important work
→ Make standups more engaging with "roast" mode

This is what happens when you solve your own pain points! 💪

## Post Option 3: Story Format

📖 Story time: How I stopped saying "I forgot" in standup meetings

Two weeks ago, I realized I was spending 10+ minutes every morning trying to remember what I did the previous day for standup. Sound familiar?

So I built something about it.

🛠️ Introducing: Dev-Standup Automator

A CLI tool that scans your git commits and uses AI to generate standup-ready summaries.

Here's what makes it special:

1️⃣ Zero Setup Friction
Just paste a GitHub URL. The tool clones, scans, and cleans up automatically.

2️⃣ 100% Local AI
Uses Ollama - no API keys, no cloud dependency, no costs.

3️⃣ Actually Fun
Three modes: Professional, Sarcastic Roast, or Epic Hero narratives.

4️⃣ Smart Filtering
Shows only your commits, or everyone's. Your choice.

Example output (Roast Mode):
"Oh look, another 'quick fix' at 2 AM. Spoiler: it wasn't quick 🙄"

The tool I needed exists now. And it saves me real time every single day.

Building solutions to your own problems >>> everything else.

What's a developer pain point you've solved recently?
